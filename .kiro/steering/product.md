# Product Overview

## MCP Style Agent Collection

A collection of local MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents designed for cognitive enhancement and systematic reasoning. The project implements specialized agents that work together to break cognitive limitations through structured thinking processes.

## Core Product

**Deep Thinking Engine** - A comprehensive framework that enhances human cognitive capabilities through:

- Problem decomposition and systematic analysis
- Multi-source evidence gathering using LLM web search
- Multi-agent debate and perspective analysis  
- Critical evaluation using Paul-Elder standards
- Cognitive bias detection and mitigation
- Innovation methods (SCAMPER/TRIZ)
- Socratic reflection and metacognitive awareness

## Key Principles

- **Privacy-First**: Core reasoning runs locally, only search queries sent externally
- **Pluggable Architecture**: YAML-configurable thinking flows and custom agents
- **Transparent Process**: Complete thinking traces with visualization
- **Scientific Methods**: Based on cognitive science and learning research
- **Modular Design**: Shared components across multiple MCP agents

## Target Users

Developers, researchers, and knowledge workers who need systematic approaches to complex problem-solving and want to leverage AI for enhanced cognitive capabilities while maintaining privacy and control.
